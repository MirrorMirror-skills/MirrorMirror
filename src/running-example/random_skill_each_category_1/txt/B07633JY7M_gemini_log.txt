  text: "**Five App Icon Ideas for Thunderstorm Sounds and Background Videos App:**\n\n1. **A silhouette of a person meditating in front of a thunderstorm.** This icon would convey the app\'s focus on relaxation and de-stress.\n2. **A thunderstorm cloud with raindrops falling.** This icon would be visually appealing and accurately represent the app\'s primary feature of thunderstorm sounds.\n3. **A peaceful ocean scene with crashing waves.** This icon would convey the app\'s calming and relaxing nature.\n4. **A cozy fireplace with flames flickering.** This icon would be visually appealing and represent the app\'s feature of relaxing fireplace videos.\n5. **A lotus flower floating on water.** This icon would be simple and elegant, and it would represent the app\'s focus on relaxation and well-being.\n\nI hope these ideas are helpful. I believe that any of these icons would be effective in representing the app\'s topic and appealing to the target audience.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\n* The icon should use a color scheme that is calming and relaxing, such as blues, greens, and purples.\n* The icon should be simple and easy to recognize.\n* The icon should be unique and stand out from competitors in the app store.\n\nI recommend testing out different icons to see which one resonates best with users.
