B0B6WQ16Z3,Kids,"Do your kids want to take their alien friend on a silly space journey or have a unicorn discover a magical potion? They can  co-create their own original story with Alexa by choosing themes like Underwater, Space Explorer or Enchanted Forest and see it come to life on screen.

Have your child pick the hero of the story such as a magical mermaid or a funny dragon, and select additional options such as colors. Then have them sit back and watch Alexa bring it to life with funny sounds, music and visuals. There’s also a special ‘surprise me’ feature which adds a touch of Alexa’s magic to finish their story for them at any time. Whatever path your little one chooses, Alexa will create a unique story each time. The sky is the limit for what they can achieve! Have your child give it a try now by saying ""Alexa, make a story""

Once the story is done, the magic doesn’t have to stop. All your kids’ special creations are automatically saved on a gallery so they can play them back at anytime."
